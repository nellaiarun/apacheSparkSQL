# apacheSparkSQL
This is intended to demonstrate Big Data capabilities and in particular Apache SparkSQL.
It demonstrates couple of techniques that allow enterprise reporting to be done on top of Hadoop.
Both approaches use "Apache Spark" an in-meomory based data processing, which helps meet typical sub-second query response time requirements of enterprise reporting.
Approach 1: Access data stored in HDFS through Apache SparkSQL and expose it for enterprise reporting.
Approach 2: Access data stored in Hive table through Apache SparkSQL and expose it for enterprise reporting.
It uses Python language and PySpark (Apache Spark's Python API).
It uses Movie Lens data files.
Instruction for installation of Apache Spark is available.
Instruction for downloading Movie Lens data files are also provided.
